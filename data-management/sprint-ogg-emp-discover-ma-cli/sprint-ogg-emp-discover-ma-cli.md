# How do I discover GoldenGate MA instances using the EM CLI verb in Oracle GoldenGate Enterprise Manager Plug-in?
Duration: 3 minutes

## Discover GoldenGate Microservices (MA) instance

1. Ensure that you have downloaded and deployed the EM CLI client. See **Learn More**.
2. Ensure that you have a configuration file with the required values. The following is the content of a sample `microservices.txt` configuration file:

    ```
    host=abc.cloud.com
    user=empuser
    password=empuser
    port=5559
    agentURL=https://abc.cloud.com:1838/emd/main/
    targetNamePrefix=test_env_orcl_src
    ```  
3. In the EM CLI client, run the command as shown in the following example:

    ```
    <copy>
    emcli discover_ggma -configFile="/path/microservices.txt"
    </copy>
    ```   
The Discovery process begins and gets completed as follows:
```
Discovering GoldenGate Instances targets in host:abc.cloud.com:9001
Begin GoldenGate target discovery...
Number of targets discovered : 6
Discovered Agent Monitored GoldenGate Targets.
Verifying targets discovered...
Number of new targets found: 6
Saving newly discovered targets...
Successfully saved targets.
GoldenGate discovery completed successfully.
```

**Content of the configuration file**

The `configuration file` (here `microservices.txt`file) contains the following mandatory parameters:

* host - Hostname of Oracle GoldenGate Service Manager. For example, `abc.cloud.com`
* port - Port of Oracle GoldenGate Service Manager.
* user - Username to connect to Oracle GoldenGate Service Manager. For example, *empuser*.
* password - Password to connect to Oracle GoldenGate Service Manager.
* agentURL - Enterprise Manager Agent URL. For example, `https://abc.cloud.com:1838/emd/main`.
* targetNamePrefix - Enter the target name prefix. For example, `test_env_orcl_src`. The target name prefix is appended with colon (":") and this gets prefixed to all target names. For example, `test_env_orcl_src:targetName`. This is an optional parameter.
